# foldgraph
Roberto Toro, May 2017

## Description
Folding patterns in different species are very characteristic, however, their description remains mostly qualitative. 'foldgraph' is a script to convert folding patterns into graphs. These graphs can then be compared quantitatively, using for example the Graph Edit Distance algorithm.
